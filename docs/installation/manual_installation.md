# Manual Installation

### Manual Installation Specific Prerequisites
Changes you need to do only when running the application manually. 
#### Frontend Modifications
Head over to `frontend/vite.config.js` and follow the instructions there(you will need to do this is the latest commit is from the main branch)
You will need to comment the line
```js
const { REACT_APP_BASE_URL, REACT_APP_API_URL } = process.env;
```
and uncomment these lines
```js
const REACT_APP_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8080";
const REACT_APP_API_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000";
```
#### Backend Modifications
The file `pacmanweb/config.py` has a variable called `MODE` which should be set to `dev` if using manual setup.
```py
MODE = "dev"
```

### Frontend Installation
To install frontend dependencies, start by installing node and npm. Instructions to do so can be found here- https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-installer-to-install-nodejs-and-npm

```none
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend Installation
#### Install Conda Environments
Head over to the PACManWeb directory. This environment installation has been done using Mamba and tested on Linux and Mac. Installing might work using Conda, but Mamba is recommended. To install mamba, head over too the [mamba installation page](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html).
```bash
mamba env create --file env.yml --name pacmanweb
```
Instructions to install the PACMan environment are listed here- https://github.com/spacetelescope/PACMan?tab=readme-ov-file#installation.


#### Config Variables
PACManWeb needs access to a `secrets.json` file to work, this needs to be present in the root of the PACManWeb repository.
The `secrets.json` file will be like this-
```json
{
    "secret_key": "",
    "default_password":"",
    "ADS_DEV_KEY": "",
    "ENV_NAME":"",
    "users": {
        "user1": "password1";
        "user2": "password2"
    }
}
``` 
The secret key is a hash and can be generated by 
```bash
python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())'
```
The `user` key is a dictionary with key value pairs of users and their passwords. The default password is your password to access the application API. PACManWeb uses Basic Auth for secure transmission of files and execution of the application. `ADS_DEV_KEY` is the key that PACMan would use to access the ADS Database. `ENV_NAME` contains the name of the conda environment of PACMan.

#### Setting up Celery
PACMan web implements task queues in Celery to run PACMan tasks one by one. Celery requires Redis as backend and RabbitMQ as a message broker to run.
- Redis installation instructions can be found on the redis website- https://redis.io/docs/install/install-redis/.
- Redis can also be installed like so-
```bash
docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
```
- RabbitMQ instructions can be found here- https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html. Once installed, RabbitMQ will need to be setup with these commands- https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/rabbitmq.html#setting-up-rabbitmq.

Once Redis and RabbitMQ are setup, you can start running celery. 
```none
celery -A pacmanweb.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
```

#### Starting Flask Application
To start Flask in developement mode-
```bash
flask run
```
