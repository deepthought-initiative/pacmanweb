# Installation Prerequisites

```{note}
Before starting, ensure git is installed on your machine-
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-git-on-ubuntu 

Since PACManWeb is hosted as a private repository on GitHub, you might need to pull frequently for testing. Doing the following will make sure your credentials persist-
```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

Start off by cloning the GitHub repo and updating the PACMan submodule.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:deepthought-initiative/pacmanweb.git
git submodule update --init
```

#### Config Variables
PACManWeb needs access to a `secrets.json` file to work, which needs to be present in the root of the repository. 
The file can be something like below. Please note however that these values won't work and you will need to replace them with real ones.
```json
{
    "secret_key": "32a35a79a7be3aa09ea225092fcca534bf20b2116caaeb98c3c59c01634e82b5",
    "default_password":"XYZ",
    "ADS_DEV_KEY": "9Ks2TfBnRhXxYmPqG7LvNwZjD6Oc3E0Uy5Wa8J1",
    "ENV_NAME":"pacman_linux",
    "users": {
        "user1": "pbkdf2:sha256:600000$hrpHgmXwGvVcjLeK$fec95c9dfc471e50ec4d3a0d2102e481d9c86555ef4dcfec46c7e0cef625013d";
        "user2": "pbkdf2:sha256:600000$hrpHgmXwGvVcjLeK$fec95c9dfc471e50ec4d3a0d2102e481d9c86555ef4dcfec46c7e0cef625013d"
    }
}
``` 
The secret key is a hash and can be generated by 
```bash
python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())'
```
- The `users` key is a dictionary with key value pairs of users and their hashed passwords.
    ```{note}
    You can use `werkzeug.security` to hash passwords. `werkzeug` will be present by default in the PACManWeb environment. See [here](../installation/manual_installation.md) on how to install the PACManWeb environment. 
    ```py
    from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
    generate_password_hash("<your password>", method='pbkdf2:sha256')
    ```
- The default password is your password to access the docs page.
- `ADS_DEV_KEY` is the key that PACMan would use to access the ADS Database. 
- `ENV_NAME` contains the name of the *conda environment of PACMan*, for example in case of linux, this could be `pacman_linux`. Instructions to install the PACMan environment are listed here- https://github.com/spacetelescope/PACMan?tab=readme-ov-file#installation.


The web app can be installed using Docker Compose or manually. For production, Docker Compose is recommended while manual installation is recommended for local deployment and testing.

#### For Docker Compose Setup
