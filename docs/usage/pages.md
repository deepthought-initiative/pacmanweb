# Running PACMan

PACManWeb contains specialized pages for different types of PACMan tasks, including proposal categorization, matching reviewers to proposals, and finding duplicates among proposals. The website allows full control and live monitoring of each process and you can download the data that you see here on the website and also the raw one produced by PACMan.

The below screencast is running PACMan to categorise proposals of Cycle 221026. Please note that the proposals used here are not real proposals but were constructed just for demo puposes.

This is an example output of the duplication checker process. The website highlights the CS Score indicating how much a proposal is similar to another in the current cycle or in the past cycles.
