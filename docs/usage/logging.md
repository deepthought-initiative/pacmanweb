# Log Streaming and Output Management
The website streams logs from PACMan, allowing users to monitor the process in real-time. Users can download the outputs and also upload proposal files and panelist files. The website is built on Celery and Redis which enable PACMANweb to handle multiple tasks simultaneously and efficiently.
