The deepest search for rare molecules and isotopologues in planet-forming disks

We propose to obtain deep 4.9-28.4 micron MIRI spectroscopy of three molecule-rich protoplanetary disks, known to show very bright water line emission in their Spitzer
spectra. Infrared molecular emission from protoplanetary disks traces material near 1 AU - the terrestrial planet forming region. The deep spectra will be used to search
for the rarest molecular species that JWST can detect, including heavy isotopologues of water, as well as important carriers of nitrogen and carbon. We will in particular
search for H2_18O to measure the H2_16O/H2_18O ratio in disks and determine whether the oxygen is enriched in the heavier isotopologue as is seen in primitive
solar system material. We will also search for warm NH3 and CH4 as signposts of a vigorous primordial chemistry in the terrestrial planet-forming region. As the volatility
of the molecular carriers of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen determine the amount of each are available for accretion onto planets, these observations will provide a critical
comparison to exoplanet atmospheric chemistry.
As a critical and necessary part of this proposal, we will obtain deep spectra of two bright asteroids for the construction of very high signal-to-noise ratio spectral
response curves (SRFs). Such empirical SRFs are needed to robustly remove the strong, high-frequency fringes present in MIRI-MRS at the ~20% level, and were similarly
critical for calibrating the Spitzer-IRS mid-infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks. Recognizing the importance of conservative fringe removal for other MIRI-MRS
programs, we waive the exclusive access period so that other MRS spectra of bright point sources can realize their full scientific potential.
