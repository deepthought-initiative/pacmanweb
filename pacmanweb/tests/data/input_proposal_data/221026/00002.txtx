Physical Properties of the Triply-Lensed z = 11 Galaxy

The z = 11.1 galaxy MACS0647-JD is one of the two most distant objects known. It is strongly lensed by a foreground cluster to form three images, with AB mag =
25.9, 26.1, and 27.3, which enables a detailed study with JWST. This provides us with a unique opportunity to begin to study the early phases of galaxy formation at
the cosmic age of only 400 Myr, aided by nature’s own cosmic lens. Despite the magnification, the system is spatially unresolved with HST, which means its radius must
be < 100 pc, the size of Giant Molecular Clouds. Packed into that small radius is a significant stellar mass (1e7 – 1e9 Msun) that is producing new stars at a rate of a
few Msun / yr. Our proposed NIRCam and NIRSpec observations will allow us to obtain significant new insights into the nature of this young galaxy that are beyond the
reach of current facilities, including:
1) A precise spectroscopic redshift from one or more lines
2) More precise measurements of the SFR, stellar mass, age, and dust extinction
3) Delensed spatial resolution down to 30 pc to estimate the galaxy’s effective radius and constrain the properties of smaller structures within
4) First constraints on metallicity and ionizing strength of a galaxy at z=11
In addition to the z=11 galaxy, we will study the large number of (~30) known z ~ 6 – 8 candidates in this field plus new discoveries of fainter candidates at z ~ 6 – 11
and perhaps beyond in this exceptional strong lensing field. We waive exclusive access to all data obtained from this program, and will release reduced data products,
lens models, and analysis notebooks to aid the community.
