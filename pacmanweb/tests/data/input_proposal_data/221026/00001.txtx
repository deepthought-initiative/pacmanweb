Extreme Events on Gas Giants: Impacts and Storm Eruptions
Leigh Fletcher
University of Leicester
We propose a non-disruptive target of opportunity proposal to observe the aftermath of giant impact events or storm plumes on Jupiter and Saturn. Although such
events are likely to occur within the foreseen lifetime of JWST, they remain impossible to predict in advance. JWST could provide spectroscopic maps of reflected
sunlight (NIRSPEC) and thermal emission (MIRI), allowing us to derive the 3D structure of temperatures, winds, chemical composition and aerosols associated with these
unique and rare events. For planetary impacts, the distribution of energy and chemicals (like ammonia) from the impact can reveal the impactor direction, penetration,
and tensile strength; the reducing or oxidising chemistry can reveal the water content of the impactor; and the silicate debris can reveal its origins and chemical makeup. For giant planet storms, the thermal strucure can reveal the energy released by the storm and the vigour of the rising motions; while the presence of unusual
chemicals and aerosols can reveal the processes shaping jovian meteorology and provide a unique window onto the chemistry of the deeper, sub-cloud regions. The ToO
will specifically target spectroscopy that cannot be reliably obtained from Earth, and will be supported by ground-based observations tracking the evolving impact/storm
morphology. Only large impacts with early signs of debris, or significant and rare storms (particularly on Saturn), will be considered for this JWST trigger.
