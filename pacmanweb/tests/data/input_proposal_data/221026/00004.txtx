A Time Series Calibration of Medium Resolution Spectroscopy with MIRI

University of Maryland
We propose to test the stability of MIRI Medium Resolution Spectroscopy for time series observations, such as for transiting exoplanets. Being a calibration proposal, we
observe a control-type source that exhibits a small variation whose charateristics are known. We will observe the bright Algol-type eclipsing binary R Canis Majoris over
an 9.5-hour period spanning secondary eclipse, using one grating position. The primary technical goals of our observations are: 1) to define the limiting instrumental
noise (“noise floor”) in time-series observations over small wavelegth scales (pixel-to-pixel) that are the most relevant for spectroscopy, 2) to determine how to
decorrelate and remove the instrumental noise, 3) to define the temporal stability of the instrumental fringing, and 4) to explore the implications of our results for
exoplanet spectroscopy. The secondary star in R CMa is a K-dwarf, that will exhibit weak (0.4-percent) rotational lines of OH in its emergent spectrum. In addition to
our primary technical goals, a secondary goal is a technical demonstration: we will use the secondary eclipse technique to measure the OH line spectrum of the K-dwarf
in this binary system, just as exoplanet observers will seek to measure the emergent spectra of exoplanets in the thermal infrared. By demonstrating that we can derive
an astrophysically credible spectrum of the K-dwarf to high signal-to-noise ratio, we will further validate the process of observing exoplanetary spectra with MRS. We will
produce specific deliverables, including a python code to extract spectra from the focal plane images, with instrumental noise removed.
