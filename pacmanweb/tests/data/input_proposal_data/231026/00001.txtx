Program Title: NIRSpec Spectroscopy of a Remarkably Luminous Galaxy at z=10.19
Principal Investigator: Harikane, Yuichi

We propose NIRSpec and NIRCam observations for an extremely luminous galaxy, XMM3-3085 at z=10.2
with Muv=-23.7 mag, whose high redshift is suggested by recent HST grism spectroscopy. XMM3-3085 is
the most luminous galaxy at z>10, and such a luminous system is not expected theoretically, indicating an
unusually vigorous period of early star formation with high efficiency, the existence of AGN activity, or stellar
populations characterized by a top-heavy initial mass function possibly with Pop-III stars. Thanks to its bright
nature, a quick 1 hour NIRSpec/PRISM observation will allow us to confirm the HST-based redshift
efficiently, and moreover, detect various emission lines including OIII]1665, CIII]1908, [OII]3727, [NeIII]3869,
Hdelta, Hgamma, and [OIII]4363. Combined with NIRCam observations tracing the continuum redder than
the Balmer break, we will measure the physical parameters including the [OIII]4363-based matallicity for the
first time at z>10, to understand early stellar mass assembly and dust and metal enrichment, and will
discuss the physical nature of this remarkably luminous galaxy, whose existence is a challenge for current
galaxy formation models.
