Program Title: The interiors of Jupiter Trojans as tracers of Solar System evolution
Principal Investigator: Brown, Michael
PI Institution: California Institute of Technology
The Nice models of solar system-wide dynamical instability predict that the Jupiter Trojans should be derived
from the same region and thus have the same icy composition as the objects in the Kuiper belt. Spectra
have shown no relationship between the surface compositions of these objects (and Cycle 1 spectra have
made the differences even more dramatic), but it is plausible that the higher temperatures of the Jupiter
Trojans would sufficiently modify Kuiper belt surfaces to make them unrecognizable. We have identified 4
~20km Jupiter Trojans with albedos elevated above the typical Trojan values. Statistically, this is
approximately the number of objects of this size which are expected to have had catastrophic collisions in
the past ~100 Myr. These objects are plausibly the largest recent impacts in the Jupiter Trojan population
and could retain the spectroscopic signatures of fresh interior materials. We propose a short reconnaissance
program designed to measure the surface composition of these objects. Such a program could quickly and
definitively establish the connection between the Jupiter Trojans and the Kuiper belt objects, confirming an
early dynamical instability in our solar system
