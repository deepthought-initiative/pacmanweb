The inner regions of protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars display remarkable diversity in their infrared
molecular line emission, as discovered in surveys with Spitzer, suggesting that inner disks (inside the water
snowline ~ 1 au) have diverse C/O ratios at ~1 Myr of age. Chemical diversity of this kind is expected to
result from planet formation and disk evolution. Core accretion is expected to efficiently convert icy solids
into planetesimals and protoplanets (a process that dehydrates the inner disk), while pebble inflow (a
process that superhydrates the inner disk) is expected to dominate at early times or in disks that fail to
convert most of their icy solids into planetesimals. By surveying molecular line emission from inner disks as
a function of age, we can infer the roles these processes play (their timescale, prevalence, and extent) in the
evolution of disk populations. We therefore propose to study an older population of disks in the IC 348
cluster (~ 3 Myr). With the high sensitivity of MIRI-MRS, it is now possible to study disks beyond the nearest
star forming regions (> 140 pc) and probe such populations. Our study will complement earlier Spitzer and
current JWST studies of young disks (~1 Myr), provide valuable constraints on theories of disk evolution,
and inform our understanding of planet formation in disk populations.
